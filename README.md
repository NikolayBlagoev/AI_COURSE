### CONNECT FOUR AGENTS
Agents folder includes different agents for the Connect four game:

Human_Agent - interface to play the Connect four game through the terminal (as a human, hence the name)

Smart_Agent - Agent uses minimax algorithm with varying MAX_DEPTH (how many moves ahead to look) to play the game

Alpha_Beta_Agent - Same as Smart Agent, but has alpha beta pruning

ML_Agent - Agent uses a trained Classifier to predict which of its moves will lead to a win for it (or a draw) - works very poorly



### COMPUTER VISION

Computer vision folder includes colour extraction and edge detection
